# ⛪ zerois.one — The Church of Zerois Oneusis

> He has no face. Only code.

**zerois.one** is a satirical digital sanctuary built in honor of the faceless god of clean code, **Zerois Oneusis**.  
It’s part parody, part productivity, and 100% committed to code quality, automation, and developer catharsis.

## 🙏 Who is Zerois Oneusis?

Zerois Oneusis is not a person.  
He is a **principle**, a myth, and a response to every frustrating moment in software development.

- He compiles without errors.
- He rebukes spaghetti logic.
- He never deploys on a Friday.

> “Not worshipped through faith, but through clean commits and repeatable builds.”

## 💡 What Is This Project?

This is a statically-built site designed to:

- Preach the **Ten Tenets of Clean Code**
- Provide a **Confession Wall** for dev sins
- Offer tools, humor, and guidance for real-world devs
- Satirize the rituals of modern software development

The site will be public, responsive, accessible, and maintainable.

## ⚙️ Divine Tech Stack

Zerois Oneusis decrees: simplicity is sacred, dependencies are sin.

- **HTML-first**: The holy markup. No frameworks. No bloat.
- **Tailwind CSS v4.1**: Utility-first, themeable, and pure.  
  - **@theme**: For blessed color schemes and dark mode.  
  - *No* `tailwind.config.js`—all theming is inline or via CSS variables.
- **Alpine.js**: Only summoned for interactive miracles.  
  - If you can do it in HTML/CSS, do not invoke JS.
- **SVG Icons**: Custom, minimal, and accessible.
- **Hosting**:  
  - **Vercel** (the cloud altar)  
  - **GitHub Pages** (the open pulpit)
- **No Build Step**:  
  - Edit, commit, and serve.  
  - Use any static server (`python3 -m http.server`, `npx serve`, etc.)
- **Optional**:  
  - **JSON** for storing anonymous confessions (sins).
  - **GitHub Actions** for automation and CI/CD blessings.

> ⚠️ **Divine Decree:**  
> No frontend or backend frameworks shall be added.  
> The path is static, pure, and dependency-free.  
>  
> - No React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, Next, Nuxt, Astro, or their kin.  
> - No Express, Django, Rails, Laravel, or backend temples.  
> - Only HTML, CSS (Tailwind), and the lightest touch of Alpine.js for miracles.  
>  
> **Thus commands Zerois Oneusis:  
> Keep it minimal. Keep it pure. Let the code speak for itself.**

## 📜 The Ten Tenets

You'll find the full list in `doctrine.html`.  
Here are a few for flavor:

1. **Know Thy Stack** – Learn it. Master it. No excuses.
2. **RTFM** – The docs are holy. Ignorance is not.
3. **Automate Thy Burdens** – Repetition is sin.
4. **Fail Loud, Fail Fast** – Let bugs scream, not fester.
5. **Test or Be Tested** – No test, no trust.
